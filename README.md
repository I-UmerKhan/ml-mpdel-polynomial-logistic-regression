# ml-mpdel-polynomial-logistic-regression
Polynomial logistic regression is used for modeling nonlinear relationships in data where the decision boundary between classes is not linear. It extends logistic regression by introducing polynomial terms of the input features, allowing for a more flexible decision boundary that can capture complex patterns in the data.
